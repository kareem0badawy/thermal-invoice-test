## 🖥️ How It Works

1. App starts an Express server on `http://localhost:4000`.
2. User opens the UI and manages printers, jobs, and logs.
3. To print:
   - POST to `/print-from-url` with:
     ```json
     {
       "url": "https://some-invoice-page.com",
       "printers": ["HP Printer 1", "HP Printer 2"],
       "token": "your_jwt_token",
       "copies": 2
     }
     ```
   - The app:
     - Opens a hidden browser.
     - Injects the token into `localStorage`.
     - Waits until `window.invoiceReady === true`.
     - Silently prints to the selected printer(s).

4. All actions are logged and visible in the UI under "السجل".
